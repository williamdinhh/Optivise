# 🚀 Deployment & Production Guide

## ✅ Your Platform is Ready!

The Statsig integration is complete and ready for production use!

## 🎯 What's Implemented

✅ Real-time event tracking with Statsig
✅ AI variant generation with Gemini
✅ Live event capture toggle
✅ Real metrics analysis
✅ Terminal analytics dashboard
✅ Production-ready architecture

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your hosting platform:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STATSIG_CLIENT_KEY=client-qFzSZVimIzwC9zb8mM91G0qkiAL4lEOCoj6vTHsq2Sa
STATSIG_SERVER_KEY=secret-your-statsig-server-key (optional)
```

### 2. Statsig Console Setup

While our platform tracks events automatically, you can enhance your setup:

#### Option A: Automatic (What We Built)
- ✅ Events log automatically when you click "Start Capture"
- ✅ Variants are tracked by their IDs
- ✅ Metrics flow to Statsig in real-time
- ✅ AI analyzes the data automatically

#### Option B: Manual Console Setup (Optional Enhancement)
1. Go to https://console.statsig.com
2. Create a new Experiment
3. Add variant groups matching your variant IDs
4. Configure metrics and goals
5. Our events will feed into your experiment

**Note**: Option A works perfectly out of the box! Option B gives you the full Statsig Console features.

## 📊 Managing Experiments

### Creating New A/B Tests

1. **In Your App**:
   - Generate variants with AI
   - Click "Start Capture"
   - Share link with users
   - Monitor in real-time

2. **In Statsig Console** (Optional):
   - View all logged events
   - Create custom dashboards
   - Set up alerts and notifications
   - Export data for further analysis

### Deploying Winners

When AI recommends a winner:

```bash
# 1. Run analysis
npm run analyze

# 2. Review AI recommendation
# Look for the winner badge 🏆

# 3. Apply in your app
# Click the variant in the dashboard
# It becomes the new default

# 4. (Optional) Push to production
# Deploy the winning variant permanently
```

## 🔄 Continuous Testing Workflow

```
Generate Variants → Deploy → Start Capture → Collect Data → AI Analyzes → Apply Winner → Repeat
```

## 📈 Scaling Up

### For More Traffic:
- Statsig free tier: 1M events/month
- Paid plans: Unlimited events
- Our platform scales automatically

### For More Variants:
- Generate as many as needed
- AI handles any number
- Statsig tracks them all

### For Team Collaboration:

- Multiple moderators can generate variants
- Centralized analytics dashboard

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Do:
✅ Keep `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
✅ Use environment variables in production
✅ Rotate API keys regularly
✅ Monitor Statsig usage dashboard

### Don't:
❌ Commit API keys to git
❌ Share server keys publicly
❌ Expose keys in client-side code (except NEXT_PUBLIC_ keys)

## 💡 Production Tips

### Performance
- Statsig SDK is lightweight (~50KB)
- Events batch automatically
- Minimal impact on page load

### Monitoring
```javascript
// Add to your app for production monitoring
client.on('values_updated', () => {
  console.log('Statsig values updated');
});
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Already implemented in StatsigProvider
// Handles network errors gracefully
// Falls back to default behavior
```

## 🎯 Next-Level Features

Want to add more? Here are ideas:

### 1. Feature Flags

```

### 2. Dynamic Config
Change app behavior without redeploying:
```typescript
const config = client.getConfig('app_config');
```

### 3. Holdout Groups
